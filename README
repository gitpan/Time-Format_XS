Time/Format_XS version 0.10
===========================

This is a companion module to Time::Format.  It contains a version of
the time_format function written in C, so it is much faster.

Time::Format (versions 0.10 and later) automatically detect whether
Time::Format_XS is installed.  If so, it will load the module and use
it for speed improvement.  If not, it will use its own pure perl
implementation.  Either way, any programs that use Time::Format do not
need to change.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, do the standard Perl module four-step:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the following internationalization C header files

  locale.h
