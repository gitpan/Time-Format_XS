eTime/Format_XS version 1.03
===========================

This is a companion module to Time::Format.  It contains a version of
the time_format function written in C, so it is much faster.

Time::Format (versions 0.10 and later) automatically detect whether a
compatible version of Time::Format_XS is installed.  If so, it will
load the module and use it for speed improvement.  If not, it will use
its own pure perl implementation.  Either way, any programs that use
Time::Format do not need to change.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, do the standard Perl module four-step:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note that Windows users using Microsoft Visual C will need to run
VCVARS32.BAT before running "perl Makefile.PL", and will need to use
nmake.exe (available for free from microsoft.com) instead of make.

Or wait until ActiveState makes the module available in their
repository.  :-)

Strawberry perl users on Windows should use dmake instead of make.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the standard C header file locale.h, which should
be installed with any ISO compliant C compiler.

If the POSIX langinfo.h header file is not available on your system,
non-English month and weekday names will return English names only.
